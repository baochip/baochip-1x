# BIO

The BIO is the Baochip I/O block. It is a 100% open source, free-as-in-beer-and-as-in-speech I/O coprocessor.

More docs to come.

```
FIFO - 8-deep fifo head/tail access. Cores halt on overflow/underflow.
- x16 r/w  fifo[0]
- x17 r/w  fifo[1]
- x18 r/w  fifo[2]
- x19 r/w  fifo[3]

Quantum - core will halt until host-configured clock divider pules occurs,
or an external event comes in on a host-specified GPIO pin.
- x20 -/w  halt to quantum

GPIO - note clear-on-0 semantics for bit-clear for data pins!
  This is done so we can do a shift-and-move without an invert to
  bitbang a data pin. Direction retains a more "conventional" meaning
  where a write of `1` to either clear or set will cause the action,
  as pin direction toggling is less likely to be in a tight inner loop.
- x21 r/w  write: (x26 & x21) -> gpio pins; read: gpio pins -> x21
- x22 -/w  (x26 & x22) -> `1` will set corresponding pin on gpio
- x23 -/w  (x26 & x23) -> `0` will clear corresponding pin on gpio
- x24 -/w  (x26 & x24) -> `1` will make corresponding gpio pin an output
- x25 -/w  (x26 & x25) -> `1` will make corresponding gpio pin an input
- x26 r/w  mask GPIO action outputs

Events - operate on a shared event register. Bits [31:24] are hard-wired to FIFO
level flags, configured by the host; writes to bits [31:24] are ignored.
- x27 -/w  mask event sensitivity bits
- x28 -/w  `1` will set the corresponding event bit. Only [23:0] are wired up.
- x29 -/w  `1` will clear the corresponding event bit Only [23:0] are wired up.
- x30 r/-  halt until ((x27 & events) != 0), and return unmasked `events` value

Core ID & debug:
- x31 r/-  [31:30] -> core ID; [29:0] -> cpu clocks since reset
